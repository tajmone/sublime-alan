# ==============================================================================
# Alan Transcript Syntax (for Alan IF games' commands scripts)
# ==============================================================================
# Syntax definition for Alan IF Adventures transcript files:
# -- https://www.alanif.se
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adventure transcript files are recordings of an adventure gameplay, generated
# by the interpreter. Historically, Alan transcripts used the ".log" extension,
# but since this is a common extension shared by so many log files, Alan has now
# adopted ".a3t" as the official extension for its transcripts.
#   Since this package introduced the ".a3log" arbitrary extension when there
# wasn't an official one, it will keep using both, at least for a grace period
# of a year or two, because ".a3log" has been adopted by various projects, and
# we want to allow them time to migrate to the new official extensions -- which
# won't be supported until the  next Alan Beta release.
#   The need to create a dedicated syntax is mainly due to the fact that Alan
# transcript files needs to be encoded in ISO-8859-1 in order to display
# correctly special chars (like accented letters), therefore Sublime Text must
# be made aware of the extension. But the syntax can also provide some basic
# syntax highlighting, and be associated to a theme, allowing users to customize
# its aesthetics.
